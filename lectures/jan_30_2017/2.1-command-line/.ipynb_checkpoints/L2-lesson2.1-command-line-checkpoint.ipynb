    "## Paths \n",
    "Every file or folder in a file system can be read, written, and deleted by referencing its position inside the filesystem. When we talk about the position of a file or a folder in a file system, we refer to its \"path\". There are a couple of different kinds of paths we can use to refer to a file – **absolute paths** and **relative paths**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directory** is an important term that's used interchangeably with *folder*. Though they are not exactly the same thing, when we say \"navigate to your project directory\" think of this as \"navigate to your project folder\".  Here's a little more information:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Strictly speaking, there is a difference between a directory which is a file system concept, and the graphical user interface metaphor that is used to represent it (a folder)...If one is referring to a container of documents, the term folder is more appropriate. The term directory refers to the way a structured list of document files and folders is stored on the computer. It is comparable to a telephone directory that contains lists of names, numbers and addresses and does not contain the actual documents themselves._ *Taken from [Close-To-Open Cache Consistency in the Linux NFS Client](http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfs-perf/results/cel/dnlc.html)*"
